This file contains notes and examples of data classes in kotlin.

// It is not unusual to create classes whose main purpose is to hold data. In such classes, some standard functionality and some utility functions are often mechanically derivable from the data. In Kotlin, these are called data classes and are marked with data:
// data class User(val name: String, val age: Int)
// The compiler automatically derives the following members from all properties declared in the primary constructor:
//      equals()/hashCode() pair
//      toString() of the form "User(name=John, age=42)"
//      componentN() functions corresponding to the properties in their order of declaration.
//      copy() function (see below).
// To ensure consistency and meaningful behavior of the generated code, data classes have to fulfill the following requirements:
//
//       The primary constructor needs to have at least one parameter.
//       All primary constructor parameters need to be marked as val or var.
//       Data classes cannot be abstract, open, sealed, or inner.
//       Additionally, the generation of data class members follows these rules with regard to the members' inheritance:
// If there are explicit implementations of equals(), hashCode(), or toString() in the data class body or final implementations in a superclass,
// then these functions are not generated, and the existing implementations are used.
//
// If a supertype has componentN() functions that are open and return compatible types, the corresponding functions are generated for the data class
// and override those of the supertype. If the functions of the supertype cannot be overridden due to incompatible signatures or due to their being
// final, an error is reported.
// Providing explicit implementations for the componentN() and copy() functions is not allowed.
// Data classes may extend other classes (see Sealed classes for examples).
// On the JVM, if the generated class needs to have a parameterless constructor, default values for the properties have to be specified (see Constructors).
// data class User(val name: String = "", val age: Int = 0)

// The compiler only uses the properties defined inside the primary constructor for the automatically generated functions.
// To exclude a property from the generated implementations, declare it inside the class body:

fun main() {
    data class Person(val name: String,val age: Int) {
        var money: Int = 0
    }

    data class HttpResponse(val responseCode: Int, val msg: String, val errorMsg: String? = null)

    val person = Person (
        name = "aayush",
        age = 21
    )

    person.money = 1000
    println(person.age)
    println(person.name)
    println(person.money)

    val response = HttpResponse(responseCode = 404,"Page not found")
    println(response)               // HttpResponse(requestCode=404, msg=Page not found, errorMsg=null)
}
