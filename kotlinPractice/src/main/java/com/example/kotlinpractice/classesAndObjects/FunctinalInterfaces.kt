// functional interfaces AKA SAM(single abstract method interface)
// example of functional interface
fun interface IntPredicate {
    fun accept(i: Int): Boolean
}

// SAM vs type alias
// Type aliases are just names for existing types – they don't create a new type, while functional interfaces do. You can provide extensions that are specific to a particular functional interface to be inapplicable for plain functions or their type aliases.
// Type aliases can have only one member, while functional interfaces can have multiple non-abstract members and one abstract member. Functional interfaces can also implement and extend other interfaces.
// Functional interfaces are more flexible and provide more capabilities than type aliases, but they can be more costly both syntactically and at runtime because they can require conversions to a specific interface. When you choose which one to use in your code, consider your needs:
// If your API needs to accept a function (any function) with some specific parameter and return types – use a simple functional type or define a type alias to give a shorter name to the corresponding functional type.
// If your API accepts a more complex entity than a function – for example, it has non-trivial contracts and/or operations on it that can't be expressed in a functional type's signature – declare a separate functional interface for it.

fun main(){
    val isEven = IntPredicate { it%2 == 0 }
    print(isEven.accept(10))                // true

}
