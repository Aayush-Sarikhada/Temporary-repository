// declaring extensions as members
// You can declare extensions for one class inside another class. Inside such an extension, there are multiple implicit receivers - objects whose members can be accessed
// without a qualifier. An instance of a class in which the extension is declared is called a dispatch receiver, and an instance of the receiver type of the extension
// method is called an extension receiver.

class Host(private val hostname: String) {
    fun printHostname() { print(hostname) }
}

class Connection(private val host: Host, private val port: Int) {
    private fun printPort() { print(port) }

    private fun Host.printConnectionString() {
        printHostname()                 // calls Host.printHostname()
        print(":")
        printPort()                     // calls Connection.printPort()
    }

    fun connect() {
        /*...*/
        host.printConnectionString()   // calls the extension function
    }
}

// extension properties
// since we don't add anything in class using extension, properties don't have backing field and there for in extension properties initializers are not allowed

val <T> List<T>.lastIndex: Int
    get() = size - 1

fun main() {
    //generic
    fun <T> MutableList<T>.swap(index1: Int, index2: Int) {
        val temp = this[index1]
        this[index1] = this[index2]
        this[index2] = temp
    }

    val oddNumbers = mutableListOf(1,3,5,7,9)
    println(oddNumbers)                          //1,2,3,4,5,6

    oddNumbers.swap(3,5)
    println(oddNumbers)                          //1,2,3,6,5,4

    // NOTE: extensions are resolved statically
    //       extension do not actually modify the classes they extend. By defining an extension,
    //       you are not inserting new members into a class, only making new functions callable with the dot
    //       notation on variables of this type.
    //       extension functions are dispatched statically, which means they are not virtual by
    //       receiver type.
    //       An extension function being called is determined by the type of the expression on
    //       which the function is invoked, not by the type of the result from evaluating that
    //       expression at runtime. For example:

    open class Shape
    class Rectangle: Shape()

    fun Shape.getName() = "Shape"

    fun Rectangle.getName() = "Rectangle"

    fun printClassName(shape: Shape) {
        println(shape.getName())
    }

    printClassName(Rectangle())                 //prints "Shape"

    // if a class has a member function and an extension function is defined which has the
    // same receiver type, the same name, and is applicable to given arguments, the member
    // always wins.

    // Null Receiver: Note that extensions can be defined with a nullable receiver type.
    // These extensions can be called on an object variable even if its value is null,
    // and they can check for this == null inside the body.

    //e.g.:
    fun Any?.toString(): String {
        if (this == null) return "Null"
        return toString()
    }

    val vowels = listOf("a","e","i","o","u")
    println(vowels.lastIndex)               //prints: 4

    Connection(Host("kotl.in"), 443).connect()
    // Host("kotl.in").printConnectionString()  // error, the extension function is unavailable outside Connection
    // Extensions utilize the same visibility modifiers as regular functions declared in the same scope would. For example:
    // An extension declared at the top level of a file has access to the other private top-level declarations in the same file.
    // If an extension is declared outside its receiver type, it cannot access the receiver's private or protected members.
