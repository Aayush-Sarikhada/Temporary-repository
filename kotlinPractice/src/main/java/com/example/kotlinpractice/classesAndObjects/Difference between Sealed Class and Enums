1. In sealed classes we can define sub-classes in the class itself or outside(but in  the same place where that class is visible)
   But in Enums we have define all cases/constants in the enum class itself

2. in enums if have associated values for all the constants same also if we
   associate anonymous classes with constants of enum and we provide methods in it then those methods must be overriding/implementing a global (enum level) abstract method.

   3. enum can implement an interface but can't derive from a class.
